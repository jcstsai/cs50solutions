0. BMP supports up to 2^32 (alternatively 2^24, 2^16, 2^8, 2^4, 2), GIF supports any 256 colors out of the possible 2^24, and JPEG supports 2^24
1. GIF supports animation
2. Lossy can lose some of the original data; lossless can not.
3. BMP files are not compressed, GIF is lossless, JPEG is lossy.
4. When a file is deleted, the data is not actually deleted (just deallocated).
5. You can overwrite the file area with zeros.
6. BYTE = 1 byte; DWORD = 4 bytes; LONG = 4 bytes; WORD = 2 bytes
7. A BMP must begin with 0x42, 0x4d.
8. bfsize = size of the total file, bisize = the size of just the data without the headers
9. If biheight is negative, this means the image is top-down (origin at the top left)
10. biBitCount defines the number of bits per color
11. fopen might return null if the file doesn't exist.
12. We only want to read one file object.
13. (4 - (3 * 3 % 4)) % 4 = 1
14. fseek moves us to a given offset in the file.
15. SEEK_CUR is a constant that can be passed to fseek matching the current position in the file.
16. It was Colonel Mustard in the study with the lead pipe.
